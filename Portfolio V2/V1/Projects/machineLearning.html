          Being an avid computer and technology lover, naturally I was going to get into the idea of Machine Learning and AI eventually.
          After spending christmas break reading, watching, and learning about the specific usage and functionality of various machine learning algorithms, I decided to attempt to create one from scratch within Unity using C#.

          For anyone even remotely knowledgeable in machine learning programming, you're probably wondering why I didn't use the programming language built for data processing, Numpy with Python.
          Well, for one, I saw this as a chance to learn more about C# and really learn the differentiating factors between programming languages like Python or C#.
          I also wanted to not only create it, but have a better visual representation of the neural network through Unity's interface.

          I started by creating a simpler genetic algorithm. By having the program create generation after generation and weed out the lower fitness (how well the cell does) cells, it only takes a couple generations to achieve pretty successful cells.
          To test this, I created a simple course where cells would need to weave between multiple walls. The cells that made it further through the course would get higher fitness levels and therefore, have a higher chance of having their "genetics" being passed down to the next generation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I then moved on to a more complex machine learning algorithm known as back-propogation. This method uses matrix math and error adjusting to travel back through a neural network and change the weights and biases as it travels back.
          While being more complex, this method can result in much more accurate results. To complete these calculations optimally, a Matrix data representation was necessary.
          As I was creating this all from scratch, I used this opportunity to create a Matrix data representation filled with methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and many other operations.
