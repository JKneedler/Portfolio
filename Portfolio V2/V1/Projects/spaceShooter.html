          After a dozen half-done games, I wanted to commit to getting something closer to full completion. I wanted to get a taste of the entire game development process from start to finish.
          I went through a lot of ideas but the one thing that stuck out to me was the idea of just a classic space shooter. It was much simpler than some huge open world rpg but allowed for plenty of creativity and customization in powers and enemies/bosses.

        </div>
        <p>
          The programming end of things for this project turned out to be much simpler than many of my other projects. However, what I learned about planning out and organizing a full game, I felt, was much more valuable.
          From designing each enemy and attack, to thinking up new bosses and special powers, this space shooter stretched my creativity more than anything else before.
          This increased creativity contributed greatly not only to new features and capabilities in my later projects, but also to finding new ways to do things I hadn't been able to before.
