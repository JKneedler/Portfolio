          <h3>Personal Discovery</h3>
          <p>Nearly all of the knowledge and skills that I've gained have come from numerous YouTube videos, google searches, books, and plain experimentation.
             I personally believe that formal coursework can help teach the foundations, but all of that is useless without putting the time in outside of the classroom.
              I owe 99% of what I know today to 8 years of personal discovery and experimentation. </p>

          <h3>Udemy</h3>
          <p><a href="www.Udemy.com">Udemy.com</a> has been my newfound home for learning the past 3 years.
            As an owner of 14 courses and having finished courses on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/">MySQL</a>,
            <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-python-mega-course/">Python</a>, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-course-2/">Web Development</a>,
            <a href="https://www.udemy.com/blendertutorial/">Blender</a>, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/develop-augmented-reality-book-ar-business-card-with-unity/">Augmented Reality in Unity</a>,
            and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/">Java</a>, I've easily put in over 200 hours of learning from some of the best teachers.
            Udemy has become my main resource for learning anything new as it adds more structure than YouTube or Google.</p>

          <h3>The Ohio State University</h3>
          <p>A current Junior, working towards a major in Computer Science Engineering, OSU has helped me refine the many years of programming that I came into school with.
            From writing cleaner code to learning valuable cooperation and teamwork skills, formal schooling has helped branch the connection between the skills I've learned on my own and their professional applications.</p>
