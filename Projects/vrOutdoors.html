          With VR becoming increasingly useful and prominent in the professional setting, VR was something I've wanted to have a chance to develop with for years.
          After creating a budget and formal proposal, The Ohio State University has given me the chance, through a grant, to get the gear necessary to start developing in VR.

          As for the outdoors part, the Mountaineers Club at OSU has become a large part of my life over the past year and a half.
          Joining this club has allowed me to travel across the country, numerous times, to experience the outdoors like never before.
          Teaching me a respect for the outdoors and the beauty that comes along with it, I wanted to focus the VR experience on trying to capture the true essence of the outdoors as accurately as I could.
