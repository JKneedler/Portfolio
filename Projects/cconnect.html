          One of the clubs I quickly joined here at OSU was a group that brought together programmers, designers and engineers alike. We would group up and work on an original project throughout the semester.
          While I loved being able to meet other people with the same passion and drive as I, the functionality of the club was not without noticeable flaws.
          The following is a list of a few of the shortcomings I noticed after two semesters of being a part of the group.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The club was limited to 30-40 people. While this would help weed out some of the people who were less committed, this would also limit the array of skills and passions throughout the groups.</li>
          <li>Students weren't given anywhere near enough time meeting people before being put in groups, sometimes creating groups that were very poorly cooperative with both skills and commitment levels.</li>
          <li>Students were confined to creating a new idea at the beginning of the semester and having the end of the semester be the "deadline", somewhat constraining groups to simpler ideas that everyone could contribute to within the timeframe.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          While I loved the groups I've been a part of and owe that club for a lot of the passion I have today, I felt that the idea behind the club could be expanded to a much more general, University-wide network with more inclusion, networking, and creation.

          Creators Connect is created to inspire, connect, and teach students all across campus to bring their projects and ideas to life.
          By allowing students to share their own projects, ideas, and skills online, Creators Connect can help programmers and designers fill in their own gaps of knowledge through networking.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">
          Creators Connect has three main functions: Connect, Share, and Learn.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Connect:</span> Students can easily reach out to and team up with others through direct message, student look-up, or taking a look at their projects.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Share:</span> Students can easily share their past and current projects, including the skills that they have and the contributions they can make.
            They can also share ideas for projects, that can be used to find students to work with.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Learn:</span> Creators Connect can act as a "hub" of knowledge and resources for students to fill in any gaps they want filled.
            By allowing students to share resources and offer help on a wide array of topics from Java Programming to Character Animation, soon there will be nothing a team can't do.</li>
