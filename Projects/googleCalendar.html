          The largest catalyst for the beginning of this project was my desire to learn more web development.
          As I've worked with HTML and CSS in the past, I had never integrated websites with Javascript to add any true functionality.
          At the time, I was getting busier and needed to start keeping track of all that was going on. This, along with always loving the interface and functionality of Google Calendar,
          I decided that a Google Calendar Clone was the perfect starting project to truly learn all that I could.

      <div id="summary">
        <div id="currentHeader" class="secondaryHeader">
          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <div class="headerUnder" style="width: 50px;"></div>
        </div>
        <p>
          After spending nearly a month learning the inner workings of Javascript in Web Development, I ended up with a Google Calendar Clone with a few features that I'm pretty proud of.
          While not being as beautifully designed as Google Calendar, I ended up learning a lot more about database design and implementation than I had originally thought.
