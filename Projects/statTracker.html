          As a fan of data representation, especially when the data pertains to my personal life, I wanted to create an aggregation of data on a few variables in my life.
          As well as my passion for data representation, I also wanted to get an even deeper knowledge of web development, along with firebase database organization.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="summary">
        <div id="currentHeader" class="secondaryHeader">
          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <div class="headerUnder" style="width: 50px;"></div>
        </div>
        <p>
          I ended up with an online program that helps me keep track of four important variables in my life:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">Time Usage:</span> By tracking what I do every hour of my day (coding/family/friends/freetime/etc.)
            I can easily look back and decide how I need to focus my time and change my schedule going ahead.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">Food Intake:</span> After spending weeks with many other food trackers, there was always something smal that put me off with each one.
          As a programmer, naturally, my best reaction was to just make my own. This allows for significant customization for what macros/nutrients to focus on and to easily track the foods that I tend to eat on a daily basis.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">Daily Exercise:</span> With the addition of the food tracker and months tracking each workout in Full Fitness, I aimed to add exercise tracking as the third feature.
          This allowed for me to not only track what lifting workouts I did, but also climbing, running and biking as well.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">Budget:</span> The laast varible I wanted to add to tracker was my weekly money expenditure's. On top of everything else, money is always something crucial to keep track of.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          After being introduced to Firebase with the Google Calendar Clone, I got the opportunity to delve even deeper into understanding optimal database design.
          By using Firebase, in the future sometime, it would be quite simple to write a program to read and output the database to excel and quickly covert them to simpler forms of data representation.
          I was also able to, through Firebase, integrate an authentication system where only registered users can access the stat tracker, that way no one but I can change my own logged data.
